Sumvec.c:
    1048576, 1 -> Miss rate for D1 cache -> 6.2%
    stride 4 -> miss rate -> 15.4%
    stride 8 -> miss rate -> 27.6%
    there is a pattern of miss rate increasing with stride rate this is with about 
    equal amount of references each time (~2.1 million)

sumarraycols and sumarrayrows:
    arraycols -> 1048576, stride 8 -> 53.1%
                stride 4 -> 53.1%
                stride 1 -> 53.1%
    arrayrows -> 1048576, stride 8 -> 6.2%
                stride 4 -> 6.2%
                stride 1 -> 6.2%
                stride 16 -> 6.2%
    I was not expecting that. It makes sense that arraycols has a much higher miss rate
    and rows has a much lower one. But the rates remain the same with different strides.

Sumarray3d:
    stride 1 or 4 or 8 -> 53.1%
    no stride, faster code version -> 6.2%
    This is as expected! With the worse version, it has a veryhigh miss rate
    but with the optimal version, we access data that is closer (good spatial locality)
    so the mis rate is far lower.
